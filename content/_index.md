Hello!

I'm an Assistant Professor in [Ting Wangâ€™s lab](https://wang.wustl.edu/) at [Washington University School of Medicine](https://medicine.wustl.edu/). I obtained my PhD in Bioinformatics from [China Agricultural University](https://www.cau.edu.cn/). I've been the main developer of and is currently the Director of the [WashU Epigenome Browser](https://epigenomegateway.wustl.edu/) project. My research focuses on developing modern omics data visualization platforms using latest web technologies to facilitate researchers in understanding biological function.
